            I am 14 and my sister is 6. Our experience has been great! The teachers are purely phenomenal people.
             I like the fact that being young and all, we learn at our own rate and the teacher's don't rush us to
             learn even when we are in a virtual class, they are very helpful and kind. We've had just a few sessions
             with our CST and we already have learned so much. Desteny M",
